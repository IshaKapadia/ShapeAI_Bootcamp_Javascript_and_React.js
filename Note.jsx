        The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst
        Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an
        amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. ,and everything was explained
        from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming
        can learn. I enjoyed these 7 days
